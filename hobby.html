    <h3>
      Boxing 
      </h3>
    
      <img src="boxing.png" alt="Boxing" width="900" height="400" />
      
      <p>
        In my free time I like to practice my Boxing, I love boxing because it teaches me discipline, and self defense. It also helps me focus at work, and in school by giving me a stress relief.

      <h3>
        Wild Life
      </h3> 
      <img src="animal.jpg" alt="Cheetah" width="350" height="400" />  
      
      <p>
        I was always fascinated by animals my whole life, I love to go to the zoo and observe them. I find it mesmerizing, and peaceful to just sit and watch the wildlife, especially the colorful birds like Blue Jays, and Toucans.
      </p> 
      
      
      <h3>
        Pokemon
      </h3> 
            <img src="charizard.jpg" alt="Charizard" />  

      <p>
        Pokemon has always been something I loved collecting since I was a youth. Just like wildlife, when I collect the cards I enjoy looking at all of the cool arts, and amazing colors. I will never get tired of collecting.
      </p> 
      
      <h3>
        Computer Networking
      </h3> 
                  <img src="computer.jpg" alt="Computer Networking" />  

      <p>
        I have always been into computers since I was a youth, just like everything else listed here. I find the way they operate really fascinating, and hope to learn more about it. Especially when it comes to networking.
